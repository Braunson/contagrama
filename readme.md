ContaGrama is a project of an application that infers nutritional data off meal 
recipes through automatic natural language parsing. This repository holds 
preliminary efforts in processing [USDA Food Composition Databases][usda] and 
making it suitable for translation to Brazlian portuguese. 

_ContaGrama is pt-BR for GramCounter_. While this application will eventually 
be made available commercially at **ContaGrama.com**, its data wrangling tooling
will always remain open source. ContaGrama is an [open data][open_data] company.
